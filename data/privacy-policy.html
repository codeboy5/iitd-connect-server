    has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
    automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that
    we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
